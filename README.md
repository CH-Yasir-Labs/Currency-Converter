# Currency-Converter
This Currency Converter project uses Python and the ExchangeRate-API to convert an amount from one currency to another. Users input the source currency, target currency, and amount, and the program fetches real-time exchange rates via an API request. It validates inputs, checks for errors, and displays the converted amount accurately.
